Hi! I'm Ivan Ermacoff, I'm 15 years old and I want to be a software and game developer. I love C# and I'm currently studying it with Unity, later on I'll be learning C++ with Unreal Engine. I'd love to communicate with other developers, you can contact me on Twitter: @_1ver, or Discord: ♥ iver ♥#9069.

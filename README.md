Hi! I'm Ivan Ermacoff, I'm 16 years old and I'm a software and game developer. I use C#, C++, Java, and Python. Currently using Unity, soon will head into Unreal Engine after I'm finished with my current project. I'd love to communicate with other developers, you can contact me on Discord: iver#9069.
